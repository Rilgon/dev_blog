<p style="font-size:14px">I wanted to learn WebGl as means of demonstrating a lot of the stuff that I have in my own OpenGL C++ graphics engine.
The below scene was my first attempt and porting some of the basic components of my engine such as models, textures, cubemaps and shaders to 
javascript, as well as math components such as vectors, matrices and quaternions. The end result is this simple scene.</p>
