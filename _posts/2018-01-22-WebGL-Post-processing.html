<p style="font-size:14px">I am doing research on post-processing effects in grad school currently so I thought it would be interesting to
    start implementing some of the effects on WebGL. The basis of getting post-processing working is to render the main scene to a framebuffer
    that can be sampled in a fragment shader which draws to a quad covering the viewport. This was pretty easy in this simple graphics environment
    I have set up in WebGL, but it was quite a lot of work in my own engine...I've added the first couple of effects that came to my
    mind when I first started doing the research, such as averaging neihbor pixels and grayscale, as well as one of the first filters I looked into, 
    the Laplace filter. The effects can be swapped by using the number keys.
